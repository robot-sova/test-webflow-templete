It is important to be aware of various signs that could signal an appliance malfunction. Such signs could go unnoticed for multiple days, even weeks, leading to more expensive issues in the future. If your appliances start making loud noises that you haven&#x27;t heard before. it is time to call a professional. If you notice leaks or spills around your kitchen and laundry appliances, you should consult with your local appliance repair company. If your dryer is not heating, washer not spinning, or if your refrigerator is not cooling, it is recommended that you have it checked by a technician. All household appliances are subject to wear and tear, so make sure to keep an eye out for these signs to prevent expensive repairs in the future.</p></div></div><div data-w-id="72718071-2ae5-10e5-df55-4c1ae29326cd" class="faq-question-wrap"><a href="faq.html#" class="faq-question-bar w-inline-block"><div class="question-title-2">WHERE CAN I FIND YOUR COMPANY ONLINE?</div><div class="faq-circle-2"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64a7c92fab2d81cb4b4dd04f/64a7c92fab2d81cb4b4dd10b_plus.svg" alt="" class="plus-icon"/></div></a><div style="height:0PX" class="faq-content"><p class="faq-paragraph-2">You can find our company on Google Maps and Facebook.</p></div></div><div data-w-id="2e3a6ae7-000b-65e5-bd60-c47372ed6f6e" class="faq-question-wrap"><a href="faq.html#" class="faq-question-bar w-inline-block"><div class="question-title-2">DO I NEED TO BE AT HOME DURING MY APPOINTMENT?</div><div class="faq-circle-2"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64a7c92fab2d81cb4b4dd04f/64a7c92fab2d81cb4b4dd10b_plus.svg" alt="" class="plus-icon"/></div></a><div style="height:0PX" class="faq-content"><p class="faq-paragraph-2">Yes.

Of course, this varies depending on the make and model of the fridge, as well as how well it is taken care of. Some fridges may need to be replaced sooner, while others may last much longer.

First, you may notice that the unit isn&#x27;t cooling as well as it used to. This could be due to a build-up of dirt and dust on the coils, which inhibits the flow of air and prevents the unit from properly cooling. Another sign is if you notice that your energy bills have increased significantly; this could be due to the fridge having to work harder to maintain a consistent temperature. Lastly, if you hear strange noises coming from the fridge, that&#x27;s definitely a cause for concern! These could be indications that the compressor or evaporator fan is failing, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road.<br/></p></div></nav></div><div data-delay="0" data-hover="false" class="faq-item w-dropdown"><div class="faq-item-toggle w-dropdown-toggle"><div class="faq-title-wrapper-2"><div class="faq-title">Is a bigger fridge better?</div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e1203159595c323b8b0c92/61e122ebc39341867358e9fa_Arrow%20FAQ.svg" class="faq-arrow-2"/></div></div><nav class="faq-content-wrap w-dropdown-list"><div class="tab-content-2"><p class="faq-paragraph-2">It depends on how you use your fridge. A bigger fridge might be better if you have a large family or if you like to stock up on food, but it could also be wasteful if you don&#x27;t use all the space. The best way to figure out if a bigger fridge is right for you is to calculate how much food you usually store in your fridge and how often you go grocery shopping. If your family eats a lot of food and you shop every week, then a bigger fridge would be more convenient. But if you only cook for yourself, or if you have a small family, then a smaller fridge would probably be more efficient.<br/></p></div></nav></div><div data-delay="0" data-hover="false" class="faq-item w-dropdown"><div class="faq-item-toggle w-dropdown-toggle"><div class="faq-title-wrapper-2"><div class="faq-title">What is the most common problem with refrigerators?</div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e1203159595c323b8b0c92/61e122ebc39341867358e9fa_Arrow%20FAQ.svg" class="faq-arrow-2"/></div></div><nav class="faq-content-wrap w-dropdown-list"><div class="tab-content-2"><p class="faq-paragraph-2">The most common problem with refrigerators is that the coils get dirty and blocked, which makes the fridge work harder to keep things cold, and can eventually cause it to break down.

Similarly, the quality of the oven will also play a role in how long it lasts - a top-of-the-line model will generally last longer than a budget model.T hat being said, most experts agree that an oven should last between 10 and 15 years. So if your oven is approaching or exceeding this age range, it may be time for an upgrade. <br/></p></div></nav></div><div data-delay="0" data-hover="false" class="faq-item w-dropdown"><div class="faq-item-toggle w-dropdown-toggle"><div class="faq-title-wrapper-2"><div class="faq-title">Is it worth getting oven repaired?</div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e1203159595c323b8b0c92/61e122ebc39341867358e9fa_Arrow%20FAQ.svg" class="faq-arrow-2"/></div></div><nav class="faq-content-wrap w-dropdown-list"><div class="tab-content-2"><p class="faq-paragraph-2">Depends. If the oven is not too old and the repair is relatively minor, it might be worth repairing. However, if the oven is very old or the repair is major, it might be more economical to buy a new oven.Ovens are generally pretty reliable appliances, so if it&#x27;s past the warranty period or if the cost of repairs exceeds half of what a new oven would cost, then it&#x27;s probably wiser to get a new one. But sometimes an oven can last for many years even after its warranty has expired, so it really depends on individual circumstances.<br/></p></div></nav></div><div data-delay="0" data-hover="false" class="faq-item w-dropdown"><div class="faq-item-toggle w-dropdown-toggle"><div class="faq-title-wrapper-2"><div class="faq-title">What makes an oven stop working?</div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e1203159595c323b8b0c92/61e122ebc39341867358e9fa_Arrow%20FAQ.svg" class="faq-arrow-2"/></div></div><nav class="faq-content-wrap w-dropdown-list"><div class="tab-content-2"><p class="faq-paragraph-2">There could be a few different reasons why an oven might stop working. The first thing to check would be the power supply - make sure that the oven is plugged in and receiving power. If the oven is receiving power, the next thing to check would be the thermostat. if the thermostat is damaged or not working correctly, it could prevent the oven from reaching the correct temperature. Another possible reason why an oven might stop working could be because of a failed heating element. If one of the elements isn&#x27;t working properly, it can prevent the entire oven from getting hot enough to cook food properly. Lastly, another potential issue could be with the control panel or electronics of the oven itself.<br/></p></div></nav></div><div data-delay="0" data-hover="false" class="faq-item w-dropdown"><div class="faq-item-toggle w-dropdown-toggle"><div class="faq-title-wrapper-2"><div class="faq-title">How much does it cost to repair a built in oven?</div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61e1203159595c323b8b0c92/61e122ebc39341867358e9fa_Arrow%20FAQ.svg" class="faq-arrow-2"/></div></div><nav class="faq-content-wrap w-dropdown-list"><div class="tab-content-2"><p class="faq-paragraph-2">It depends on the issue that you&#x27;re having with your built-in oven. If it&#x27;s a simple problem like a blown fuse, it may cost around $120-$250 to replace the fuse. However, if there&#x27;s something wrong with the heating element or igniter, it could cost $200-$500 to repair. If the problem is with the main control board, it could cost up to $1,000 to fix. So, it really all depends on what&#x27;s wrong with your oven and how much it will cost to repair the issue.<br/></p></div></nav></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><footer class="section-footer"><div class="container-large"><div class="w-layout-grid footer-grid"><div class="footer-link-column"><div class="footer-name">Appliance Service Pro</div><a href="tel:(360)667-1567" class="footer-phone">(360) 667 - 1567</a><a href="contact-us.html" class="footer-booking">Schedule Service</a></div><div id="w-node-d30e4f10-1cb0-5949-0c18-06bab03c8ad0-1e540538" class="footer-link-column"><div class="footer-link-title">Hours of Operation</div><div class="w-layout-grid hours-of-operation"><div id="w-node-_9e886b57-3a55-4c5e-461c-4d8c57f15569-1e540538" class="day right-margin">Monday</div><div id="w-node-_9fc5670a-bcb8-14ef-02aa-4e981a9c7dfb-1e540538" class="time">8:00AM - 5:00PM</div><div class="day right-margin">Tuesday</div><div class="time">8:00AM - 5:00PM</div><div class="day right-margin">Wednesday</div><div class="time">8:00AM - 5:00PM</div><div class="day right-margin">Thursday</div><div class="time">8:00AM - 5:00PM</div><div class="day right-margin">Friday</div><div class="time">8:00AM - 5:00PM</div><div class="day right-margin">Saturday</div><div class="time">9:00AM - 3:00PM</div><div class="day right-margin">Sunday</div><div class="time">9:00AM - 3:00PM</div></div></div><div class="footer-link-column"><div class="footer-link-title">About Us</div><a href="about-us.html" class="footer-link">About</a><a href="faq.html" aria-current="page" class="footer-link w--current">FAQs</a><a href="oven-repair.html" class="footer-link">Our Blog</a><a href="brands.html" class="footer-link">Brands We Fix</a><a href="service-area.html" class="footer-link">Where We Service</a><a href="testimonials.html" class="footer-link">Our Reviews</a><a href="contact-us.html" class="footer-link">Contact</a></div><div class="footer-link-column"><div class="footer-link-title">Services</div><a href="refrigerator-repair.html" class="footer-link">Refrigerator Repair</a><a href="washer-repair.html" class="footer-link">Washer Repair</a><a href="dryer-repair.html" class="footer-link">Dryer Repair</a><a href="dishwasher-repair.html" class="footer-link">Dishwasher Repair</a><a href="ice-maker-repair.html" class="footer-link">Ice Maker Repair</a><a href="stove-repair.html" class="footer-link">Stove Repair</a><a href="cooktop-repair.html" class="footer-link">Cooktop Repair</a><a href="oven-repair.html" class="footer-link">Oven Repair</a></div><div class="footer-link-column"><div class="footer-link-title">Service Area</div><div class="serving-area">We provide appliance repair services to throughout <a href="../applianceserviceprollc.com/index.html" class="naked-link">Vancouver</a>, <a href="appliance-repair-portland.html" class="naked-link">Portland</a>, and neighboring cities. </div></div></div><div class="footer-line-break"></div><div class="bottom-wrapper"><div class="return-wrapper"><div class="footer-detail">All Rights Reserved © 2023<a href="http://webflow.com/"></a></div></div><div class="div-block-97"><a href="terms-of-service.html" class="terms-link w-inline-block"><div>Terms of Service</div></a><a href="privacy-policy.html" class="privacy-link w-inline-block"><div>Privacy Policy</div></a></div></div></div></footer><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=64a7c92fab2d81cb4b4dd04f" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64a7c92fab2d81cb4b4dd04f/js/webflow.a7fc529d2.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
